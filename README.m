%% This software is provided for review purposes only. It accompanies
% the CVPR paper ID 690 "3-D symmetry estimation in the phase domain" 
% To start, use "maintestscript". It will ask for a shape in .off format
% this can be one of the Princeton Shape Benchmark shapes, or SHREC'10.
% Results are plotted for the shape and its fitted symmetry plane.

% precomputed results are saved as matlab figures, which can be rotated
% interactively in 3-D using the "Camera" toobar.  The file name indicates
% the model number

% figure1.m recreates figure 1 and 3. Other figures can be recreated from the 
% scripts herein.
